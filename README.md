# Smart University

*This project was submitted as an evaluation metric for the course Microprocessor, Microcontroller and Interfacing Laboratory in United Internation University.*

This project is a hardware-software fusion. Find the software(web-app) part [here](https://github.com/S-M-J-I/Smart-University-Attendance).

## Problem Statement & Solution

Universities have many "background" processes that are done physically such as turning of room lights, attendance systems, and so on. Thus, we made a multidisciplinary electronics system that would automate these "background" tasks and save time and resources.

## Features

Our system provides:
- Automated online attendance system through biometric (fingerprint) validation. [Find the seperate repo here](https://github.com/S-M-J-I/Smart-University-Attendance)
- Automatic toggling of room lights
- Automated roof-top system for monsoon.
- Automated plant-watering system for the university's green environment.
- Electricity generation on pressure (and storage).

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno (x2)
- Node MCU Wifi Module
- Fingerprint sensor
- Microservo motor
- IR Sensor (x2)
- Piezo Elecric Sensor
- Submersible motor
